              entertainment and You might even win some money. But You cannot

              money that You cannot afford to lose. We want all Your gaming
              experiences to be positive, regardless of whether You win or not.

              tools, and give regular feedback about Your gambling habits to
              make it easier for You to keep track and stay in control.

            <p>QUICK TIPS</p>
            <p>
              We want to encourage a culture of positive play where gambling is
              something fun and happens within each playerâ€™s personal limits.
              Here are a few tips for playing responsibly:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Set a personal budget and make sure You stick to it.</li>
              <li>Only play for the fun of it, not to make money.</li>
              <li>Only gamble when sober and in a clear state of mind.</li>
              <li>Make sure You take regular breaks.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If the fun is overshadowed by negative emotions, it may be time to
              take a break or to start using the tools and support services We
              offer.
