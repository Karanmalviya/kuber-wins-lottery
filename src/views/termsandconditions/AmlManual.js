              This Policies and Procedures Manual (Manual) provides guidelines
              to the Company to meet its obligations under the National
              Ordinance on identification when rendering services
              (Landsverordening identificatie bij dienstverlening (LID), PB
              2017, no. 92), and the National Ordinance on the reporting of
              unusual transactions (Landsverordening melding ongebruikelijke
              transacties (LMOT), PB 2017, no. 99).
            </p>
            <p>
              This Manual is intended to assist the Company with meeting the
              obligations to which it is subject in Curaçao as at the date of
              this Manual.
            </p>
            <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
            <p>
              This Manual establishes the necessary procedures to be taken in
              order to prevent money laundering, terrorist financing and
              corruption. The Company does not wish to be manipulated by money
              launderers or terrorists or to become associated with money
              laundering or terrorism in general. Its aim is not merely to
              comply with its legal obligations, but to minimise the risk of
              exploitation by criminals as effectively as possible. Thus the
              anti-money laundering, terrorist financing and corruption policies
              of the Company are based on the highest standards that are
              required, and apply to all employees.
            </p>
            <p>
              Money laundering is characterised by an attempt to conceal the
              illegal source of the funds and transform them into legitimate
              funds through complex transactions typically orchestrated through
              numerous entities. Money laundering is generally motivated by
              illegal or criminal activity, once laundered; funds derived from
              illegal means can more easily be used for other purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Deception is the heart of money laundering and by its very nature
              it is a hidden activity, the general consensus amongst worldwide
              regulatory bodies is that there are three stages of money
              laundering:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Placement: placing cash proceeds/assets of criminal conduct into
                the banking system;
              </li>
              <li>
                Layering: creating complex layers of transactions to conceal the
                origin of the funds; and
              </li>
              <li>
                Integration: proceeds now appear legitimate and are “integrated”
                into the financial system.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Curacao legislation criminalises terrorism and terrorist
              financing, following UN conventions and international standards.
              Dealing with property intended to be used for terrorist purposes,
              or being involved in any arrangement in support of terrorism, are
              serious criminal offences. The financing of terrorism is
              characterised by the solicitation and collection of funds or
              assets which are intended to be put to a terrorist purpose. Whilst
              similar to money laundering, terrorist financing can be
              distinguished by the fact that the funds involved are not
              necessarily “dirty”. Funds of a perfectly legitimate source become
              criminal property by virtue of the use to which they will be put.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bribery is a criminal offence and corrupt acts expose the Company
              and its employees not only to reputational risk but to the risk of
              prosecution, fines and imprisonment. Bribery is often
              characterised by the offering or receiving of payment or some
              benefit in exchange for the exercise of influence, particularly
              with respect to the awarding of contracts. Domestic legislation in
              Curaçao makes bribery and corruption a serious offence. The
              legislation of other jurisdictions, particularly England and the
              USDopean Union, has extra-territorial reach. As such, a
              “zero-tolerance” approach is taken to acts of bribery or
              corruption and care must be taken to comply with not only the
              letter but the spirit of the law.
            </p>
            <p>THE PURPOSE AND IMPORTANCE OF THE COMPLIANCE FUNCTION</p>
            <p>
              The overall objective of the compliance function is to ensure that
              the Company complies with its regulatory obligations under the
              anti-money laundering, terrorism and corruption legislation
              applicable in Curaçao and any other jurisdiction in which the
              Company operates. The compliance function is also concerned with
              the Company’s ability to demonstrate the existence and
              effectiveness of our systems and controls.
            </p>
            <p>
              The objective of the compliance policies, systems and controls is
              to ensure that the Company can manage its compliance risk, i.e.
              the risk of legal and regulatory sanctions, material financial
              loss or reputational damage that the Company may suffer as a
              result of failing to comply with its regulatory and its anti-money
              laundering, terrorism and corruption obligations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Compliance is the responsibility of the Company and, within the
              Company, ultimate responsibility for compliance lies with the
              Company’s Board of Directors.
            </p>
            <p>REGULATORY FRAMEWORK APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANY</p>
            <p>
              The infrastructure for anti-money laundering and combating the
              financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) on Curaçao finds its legal basis
              in the National Ordinance on identification when rendering
              services (LID) and the National Ordinance on the reporting of
              unusual transactions (LMOT). These ordinances determine that all
              service providers offering the opportunity to participate in games
              of hazard in general, casinos, lotteries, and offshore games of
              hazard fall within the regulatory scope.
            </p>
            <p>
              The money laundering provisions apply to “criminal conduct” (which
              includes drug and terrorist related financial crimes). Criminal
              conduct is defined as any conduct constituting an offence in
              Curaçao or, where criminal conduct has taken place outside
              Curaçao, would constitute an offence there, this concept is known
              as “dual criminality”.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is no restriction on the type of offence committed i.e. drug
              trafficking, other crimes or terrorism offences. The Court will
              only need to consider whether a relevant business has benefited
              from any general or particular criminal conduct. General criminal
              conduct means any criminal conduct, wherever it has occurred and
              whether or not is has formed part of any criminal prosecution.
              Particular criminal conduct means the offence for which the
              defendant is being prosecuted.
            </p>
            <p>
              Criminal conduct offences include the laundering of an offender’s
              own proceeds of crime as well as assisting in the laundering of
              someone else’s proceeds. Criminal offences fall into the following
              principal categories and a person commits an offence if he:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                conceals, disguises, converts or transfers criminal property or
                removes criminal property from Curaçao;
              </li>
              <li>
                enters into or becomes concerned in an arrangement which he
                knows or suspects facilitates (by whatever means) the
                acquisition, retention, use or control of criminal property by
                or on behalf of another person;
              </li>
              <li>acquires, uses or has possession of criminal property;</li>
              <li>
                fails to disclose to a Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO)
                or the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) suspicion or knowledge
                of another person engaging in a prohibited act. Disclosure of
                suspicion to the FIU is a defence, however, failure to disclose
                may be subject to a “negligence test” whereby the Courts may
                rule that a person had “reasonable grounds” for knowing or
                suspecting criminal conduct even if they did not actually know
                or suspect; and
              </li>
              <li>
                makes a disclosure (other than to the FIU) which is likely to
                prejudice an investigation being or about to be conducted by the
                FIU (tipping off).
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The Regulations also require that relevant businesses have in
              place anti-money laundering policies, procedures and practices to
              facilitate the Relevant businesses ability to comply with the
              anti-money laundering regime of Curaçao. Specifically, the
              Regulations require that relevant businesses should not form
              business relationships or carry out one-off transactions with or
              for another person unless they:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                maintain procedures, which establish and verify the identity of
                clients;
              </li>
              <li>
                adopt a risk based approach to monitor financial activities and
                maintain adequate systems to identify risk in relation to
                persons, countries and activities;
              </li>
              <li>
                maintain procedures to screen employees to ensure high standards
                when hiring;
              </li>
              <li>maintain record-keeping procedures;</li>
              <li>establish internal reporting procedures;</li>
              <li>
                adopt appropriate internal controls and ongoing monitoring
                procedures;
              </li>
              <li>
                maintain and monitor record keeping in respect of client
                identification, accounts files and business correspondence in
                respect of the transactions of such clients;
              </li>
              <li>
                provide appropriate AML training in accordance with the
                Regulations (where applicable); and
              </li>
              <li>designate a Compliance Officer.</li>
              <ul>
                <p>
                  All of the above procedures are explained in detail under the
                  Anti-Money Laundering Policies and Procedures in this Manual.
                </p>
                <p>INTERNAL REPORTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES</p>
                <p>
                  The Company is committed to deterring money laundering and any
                  activity that facilitates money laundering or the funding of
                  terrorist activities. The dedication of the Company is
                  reflected in its desire to comply with all laws and
                  regulations designed to combat money laundering activity.
                </p>
                <p>Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO)</p>
                <p>
                  The Regulations impose a requirement that all Relevant
                  businesses carrying out relevant business appoint a MLRO and a
                  Deputy MLRO. The Deputy MLRO shall in the absence of the MLRO,
                  discharge the functions of the MLRO.
                </p>
                <p>The MLRO is responsible for:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    considering, in light of all relevant information, any
                    reports of suspicious activity made by employees of the
                    Company for the purposes of determining whether or not the
                    information contained in the report amounts to suspicious
                    activity in accordance with the applicable legislation;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    ensuring that any incidents of suspicious activity are
                    reported to the FIU and are filed in accordance with the
                    applicable legislation; and
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    maintenance of a register listing reports made to the FIU
                    and inquiries received from the FIU.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  The MLRO has a direct reporting line to the Board of Directors
                  of the Company.
                </p>
                <p>Suspicious Activity Reporting</p>
                <p>
                  All employees of the Company are required to be familiar with
                  the anti-money laundering procedures and immediately report to
                  the MLRO the occurrence of any suspicious activity. In the
                  event that an employee receives any enquiry from a law
                  enforcement agency, that inquiry shall immediately be referred
                  to the MLRO.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the MLRO determines that a suspicious activity report
                  should be filed with the FIU the report, shall be made via the
                  standard reporting form.
                </p>
                <p>Tipping Off</p>
                <p>
                  Suspicious activity reports and all supporting documentation
                  are confidential. Tipping off is an actual offence under the
                  legislation and carries with it a monetary fine and jail term.
                  Employees are prohibited from disclosing to anyone, including
                  persons involved in the transaction, information in connection
                  with a filing of a suspicious activity report. Violation of
                  this policy will result in disciplinary action and termination
                  of employment.
                </p>
                <p>CLIENT IDENTIFICATION POLICIES AND PROCEDURES</p>
                <p>
                  The Company has an obligation to determine, that
                  money-laundering activities are not being conducted. The first
                  line of defence against any money laundering activity is to
                  KNOW YOUR CLIENT. In effect, this means that enhanced client
                  identification must be collected on every client. There are
                  some exceptions to this requirement and the Company will apply
                  a “Risk-Based” analysis as required under the Regulations to
                  determine whether simplified client due diligence measures
                  should be applied to the client.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Simplified client due diligence measures (reliance on
                  exemptions) will be unacceptable in specific high risk
                  scenarios, these may include (but are not limited to):
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    a client not physically present for identification purposes
                    (non face-to-face business);
                  </li>
                  <li>politically exposed persons (PEPs);</li>
                  <li>
                    where the prospective client is from a foreign country that
                    has been identified by credible sources as having serious

                  Where a relevant business is required to maintain procedures
                  to identify its clients and has doubts about the accuracy of
                  any evidence of client identity, then satisfactory additional
                  evidence of identity must be obtained.

                  Documents to verify the identity information received will be
                  requested from a client if and when there is considered to be
                  risk or uncertainty about the information provided and prior
                  to any payment in excess of USD 1,000 per occasion or when

                <p>
                  Certain countries are associated with crimes such as drug
                  trafficking, fraud, corruption etc. and consequently pose a
                  higher risk to the Company. The Company should conduct
                  enhanced due diligence on entities/individuals based in
                  high-risk countries and caution against the acceptance of
                  certified documentation from these countries. High Risk
                  countries are listed at the FINCEN, OFAC and Transparency
                  International websites.

                </ul>
                <p>Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs)</p>
                <p>
                  The Company should also conduct enhanced due diligence and
                  apply a higher degree of vigilance when dealing with PEPs. An
                  explanation as to what constitutes a PEP is stated below:
                </p>
                <p>
                  a person who is or has been entrusted with prominent public
                  functions by a foreign country, for example a Head of State or
                  of government, senior politician, senior government, judicial
                  or military official, senior executive of a state owned
                  corporation and important political party official;
                </p>
                <p>
                  a person who is or has been entrusted domestically with
                  prominent public functions, for example a Head of State or of
                  government, senior politician, senior government, judicial or
                  military official, senior executives of a state owned
                  corporation and important political party official; and
                </p>
                <p>
                  a person who is or has been entrusted with a prominent
                  function by an international organisation like a member of
                  senior management, such as a director, deputy director and a
                  member of the board or equivalent functions. The risks occur
                  when these persons abuse their public powers and basically
                  filter their ill-gotten funds to offshore jurisdictions. The
                  Regulations impose a requirement for regulated entities such
                  as the Company to be vigilant in relation to PEPs and have
                  risk management policies in place to:
                </p>
                <p>
                  determine whether the client is a PEP, a family member
                  (includes the spouse, parent, sibling, or child of a PEP) or
                  close associate (includes any natural person who is known to
                  hold ownership or control of a legal instrument or person
                  jointly with a PEP, who maintains some other kind of close
                  business or personal relationship with a PEP, or who holds the
                  ownership or control of a legal instrument or person which is
                  known to have established to the benefit of a PEP);
                </p>
                <p>
                  obtain senior management approval for establishing business
                  with a PEP, a family member or a close associate;
                </p>
                <p>take measures to obtain source of funds information; and</p>
                <p>conduct enhanced monitoring of the relationship.</p>
                <p>
                  The degree of scrutiny that the Company will apply will depend
                  on various risk factors, including, but not limited to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    proof that the clients source of funds or wealth do not
                    emanate from criminal activity;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    whether the home jurisdiction of the PEP is one in which
                    current or former political figures have been implicated in
                    corruption; and
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    the length of time that a former political figure has been
                    in office.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  If due diligence cannot be performed adequately, the Company
                  should consider not opening the account, suspending the
                  transaction activity, filing a report with the MLRO or closing
                  the account.
                </p>
                <p>Corruption and Bribery Prevention Procedures</p>
                <p>
                  The due diligence procedures outlined above are vital not only
                  in relation to anti-money-laundering and terrorist financing
                  concerns, but to anti-bribery and corruption as well. In the
                  context of bribery and corruption legislation, it is essential
                  to know your business partners. The robust take-on procedures
                  described above for potential clients (particularly the PEP
                  procedures) operate to identify situations of high risk for
                  bribery and corruption at the initial stages of the
                  relationship. However, it is possible that the Company or its
                  staff may become indirectly involved with bribery and
                  corruption later in the relationship, or by way of association
                  with third parties. Therefore, consideration should be given
                  as to whether it is necessary to carry out due diligence on
                  certain associates, agents, contractors, facilitators and
                  others with whom the Company has a business relationship where
                  there may be a risk of bribery and corruption.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If during the course of their duties a member of staff becomes
                  suspicious of any client, business partner or staff member
                  being involved in any way in bribery or corruption, they
                  should immediately inform the MLRO. The reporting process in
                  place to report a suspicion of money-laundering should be
                  used. The MLRO will determine whether further action including
                  reporting to the authorities is appropriate and should
                  document the decision and keep a log of any such reports.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Care must be taken to ensure that the Company’s legitimate
                  business promotion initiatives do not fall afoul of the
                  bribery and corruption legislation or this policy. Such
                  initiatives include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The giving of gifts or tokens of appreciation to clients or
                    business partners;
                  </li>
                  <li>Client entertainment and hospitality;</li>
                  <li>
                    Invitations to events, functions or other social gatherings
                    in connection with matters related to our business.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  These kinds of activities are recognised as an established and
                  important part of doing business provided they fall within
                  reasonable bounds of value and occurrence. A variety of
                  cultural factors such as customs, currency and expectations
                  may influence the level of acceptability.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A reasonable level of discretion is permitted with respect to
                  such activities. Giving gifts to clients must be reasonable
                  and proportionate. Unduly lavish gifts are prohibited as they
                  could give rise to the inference of impropriety. Care is to be
                  taken in relation to the timing of gifts as there must be no
                  inference that the gift relates to the recipient being
                  involved in a pending decision affecting the Company. (For the
                  avoidance of doubt, a gift also includes the provision of free
                  services.) It is the policy of the Company that any proposed
                  gift of a value of Rs.125 or more must be approved by the MLRO
                  in advance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Occasionally staff members will be offered a gift from a
                  client or other business partner to show gratitude for the
                  work that they have done. No gift and/or favour of whatever
                  kind may be accepted from any client or supplier of the
                  Company that would in any way influence or reasonably be
                  considered to influence the staff member to act
                  inappropriately. In the event of a gift, benefit or inducement
                  of any kind being offered to a member of staff by a client or
                  business partner with a value likely to be more than Rs.125,
                  the details must be reported to the MLRO.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If a member of staff feels uncertain at any time regarding
                  acceptability of gifts, entertainment or hospitality, please
                  consult the CO or MLRO.
                </p>

                  of patterns of unusual size, volume, pattern or type of
                  transactions, geographic factors such as whether jurisdictions
                  designated as “non-cooperative” are involved, or any of the

                    regulatory or governmental inquiries; and
                  </li>
                  <li>
