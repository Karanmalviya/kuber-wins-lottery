              (Member Account) and change the Principal Currency of Your wallet
              (Member Account) from USD to EUR, You will not be able to use 100
              USD to play the Games unless You change the Principal Currency
              from EUR to USD).
            </p>
            <p>
              2.7. If You deposit an Available Currency which is different from

              Principal Currency to USD (the “Default Game Currency”) at the
              exchange rate of Rockford Holdings, and You will see
              simultaneously the balance of Your wallet (Member Account) shown
              in the Principal Currency, and the balance of Your Game session
              shown in the Default Game Currency. Default Game Currency is USD

              time to Your Game sessions may be calculated by You at any moment

              depositing of one cryptocurrency to the address of another
              cryptocurrency in blockchain. Recovery of CCD is a very dangerous
              and time-consuming process. Not all CCDs may be recovered, and the
              level of complexity, risk and time frames depend both on the type
              of currency and the address used for the deposit.
            </p>
            <p>
              Having taken into consideration all factors Rockford Holdings team
              has developed the following fee structure of a cross-chain deposit
              recovery, Rockford Holdings will recover only those CCDs
            </p>

              which exceed equivalent of 5,000.00 Euro at the moment of deposit
              transaction within a thirty
            </p>
            <p>
              (30) banking days period. The User incurs a ten (10) percent fee
              of the respective CCD (its amount) for the recovery.
            </p>
            <p>
              In order to enable the recovery process, the User has to replenish
              his/her Member Account with the above mentioned amount. After the
              successful replenishment, Rockford Holdings support and finance
              departments take steps required for the deposit recovery. The fee
              will be written off from the User’s Member Account in case of the
              successful transaction.
            </p>
            <p>
              Users should consider the described difficulties of the
              cross-chain recovery process and take into consideration a
              significant number of deposits mistakenly sent to the wrong
              address. Our team dedicates its best efforts to resolve the issue
              within the shortest time frames. Thus, we ask You to be patient.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rockford Holdings shall have the right to refuse any request aimed
              to recover deposit made by You in cryptocurrency which is not
              Available Currency.

              5.13. Maximum limit for withdrawals of a non-deposit amount bonus
              or free spins winnings cannot exceed the amount of a bonus
              applied. The remaining amount will be cancelled.
            </p>
            <p>
              5.14. Please note that funds usually will be transferred to Your
